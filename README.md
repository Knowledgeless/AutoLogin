I know there has a lot of scripts,videos on google & youtube about facebook login automation using various programming language. Actually I tried as a practice purpouse. Some external things would be required to use this script. So, follow the instruction given below. <br>

To download essential module and chrome run the command given below

Now we have to download chrome webdriver. Before downloading the driver zip file chcek your chrome version.
- Run chrome

There you will get the version you are running on. 
<br><br>
Now, Let's download chrome webdriver for selenium. To download <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads">Click Here</a>.<br>
- Download your required version. 
- Extract the zip file
- copy your drive location from location bar is showling above (Script will ask about your path to run chrome browser).
<br><br>
<h3>Run script</h3><br>
Finally you are ready. Open your terminal and got to this script file location and run these command.
